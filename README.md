# Eyes Up Here

This web app was created for the Microsoft Azure Hack for Accessibility Hackathon. The concept is to help students focus in remote learning environments by monitoring the camera and detecting when they look away from the screen for too long, or leave the view of the camera. When this happens, the app will make a little sound until the student looks back.

## Running the app

Clone this repository. If you don't have Node installed, install Node. Then, to get the required dependencies, run:
`npm install`

Then, to start the web app in your browser, run:
`npm start`
